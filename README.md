# sparkling-retro-car

Progress of my BrightSpark test assignment.
## Tasks that I managed to do so far:

- 12 units wide road
- car at the bottom of screen
- can move only left and right and can't go off read
- car moves 1 unit at a time
- roadblocks are 3 units wide and appear on random position
- roadblocks appear after 5 to 8 units randomly
- dodged roadblock gives points
- after 20sec level increased
- used the required font

## Still to do:

- collision effect which also pops up game over sign
- start and game over fade-in and fade-out animations
- sides design for outer frame of game table (was thinking of svg because with CSS I would need too many div's in HTML)

I will still try to complete all those tasks above in near future and make this 
game work like it should. Any kind a feedback is more than welcome.
